IgE	"IgE is an antibody produced by the immune system, typically in response to allergens. In pwCF, elevated IgE levels can indicate an allergic response, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), a condition caused by a hypersensitivity to the fungus Aspergillus that can lead to worsening lung function."			
Spec IgE	"Specific Immunoglobulin E measures IgE antibodies targeted at specific allergens (e.g., Aspergillus or other environmental allergens). It helps to pinpoint particular allergens that may be triggering immune responses or exacerbations in pwCF"			
Spec IgG	"Specific IgG antibodies are measured to detect immune responses to certain bacteria, viruses, or fungi. In pwCF, it is often used to assess chronic infections, such as those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, where IgG levels can reflect the body's response to long-term bacterial presence"			
Precipitins	"Precipitins are antibodies that form immune complexes with specific antigens, often used to detect fungal infections like Aspergillus in pwCF. Positive precipitins suggest that the pwCF has been exposed to certain fungi and developed an immune response, which is particularly relevant in diagnosing ABPA."			
FVC	"Forced Vital Capacity is a measure of lung function that indicates the total amount of air a person can forcefully exhale after taking the deepest breath possible. In pwCF, a reduced FVC can indicate restricted lung capacity, often due to chronic lung damage or obstruction caused by thick mucus in the airways."			
FEV1	"FEV1 measures how much air a person can forcefully exhale in one second after a full inhalation. It is a key measure of lung function in pwCF and is used to monitor disease progression. Lower FEV1 values indicate increased airway obstruction and reduced lung function, which is common in pwCF due to mucus buildup and lung infections."			
Best FEV1	Best FEV1 refers to the highest recorded FEV1 value. It represents the best lung function and serves as a benchmark to compare current lung function and assess decline or improvement over time.			
FEV1/best FEV1	Ratio of current FEV1 to Best FEV1
