# Notes on the metadata

## Culture status

- 'CS Scedosporium apiospermum' has no non-zero values, and should be dropped.
- _Burkholderia_ and _Achromobacter_ weakly correlate
- _Aspergillus_, _Mycolicibacter_, and then the _Aspergillus_, _MAC Smear Negative_, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ are all somewhat correlated
- The Pseudomonas (obviously?) correlates reasonably well with the mucoid/non-mucoid numbers, and the are anti-correlated but not that well!
